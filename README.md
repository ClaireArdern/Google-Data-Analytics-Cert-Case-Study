<h1> Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone: Case Study - In Progress </h1>
<h6> The following includes documentation of all work done in the process of completing the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification. This capstone project is a data analytics case study. </h6>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

Imagine you are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

<h2>Business Task</h2>

Analyze smart device data to gain insight into how customers are using their smart devices.

**Problem Statement:** How can the trends found in the smart device usage data be utilized to improve the BellaBeat marketing strategy? 

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

The dataset used in this case study was provided by the Google Data Analytics Certificate course. This is a public dataset made available by Kaggle user [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).

This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

<h3>Dataset Overview</h3>

This dataset is split into 2 time periods: 3/12/16 - 4/11/16 and 4/12/16 - 5/12/16. Initially, due to the mismatched number of files corresponding to each time period, it seems that the second time period includes more information than the first time period. However, this mismatched number of data files is mostly due to duplicate information represented in different formats (e.g. minute by minute rather than day by day). For this study, data that is summarized day by day will be sufficient.
